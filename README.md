# Tiles API (Pre-interview Task)

> Python Django REST API to create Tasks and Tiles

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies
pipenv install

cd pollster

# Serve on localhost:8000
python manage.py runserver
```
### Notes
Decided to give Tile a title to make more user friendly. 
Could possibly of made the Launch Date unique instead.
Launch Date could of been a Date Time Field.
Order Field maybe should of been a IntegerField.
